This library provides a drop-in SDK for Large Language Model (LLM) governance. Inspired by APM tools like New Relic, it wraps your existing LLM calls to automatically enforce security guardrails, track costs, and record audit logs—without routing traffic through a centralized gateway.

## 🚀 Features

### 🛡️ Guardrails & Security
- **In-Process Protection**: Validates inputs and outputs directly within your application process.
- **PII Detection & Masking**: Automatically redacts sensitive data (Email, Phone, Credit Cards) from model responses.
- **Secret Detection**: Blocks requests containing API keys or private tokens.
- **Policy as Code**: Define rules in `YAML` files that live with your code or centrally.

### 👁️ Observability & Cost
- **Zero-Latency Logging**: Telemetry is offloaded asynchronously to a local queue (BullMQ).
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration for full request visibility.
- **Cost Attribution**: Real-time cost calculation per provider, model, and prompt.
- **Resilient Persistence**: Dedicated Worker service handles database writes; your app stays up even if the DB is down.

### 🏗️ Architecture

The SDK follows a "Producer-Consumer" model to ensure high performance and reliability:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Your Application"
        Code[User Code] --> SDK[LLM Governance SDK]
        SDK -->|Intercept| Guardrails[Guardrails Engine]
        SDK -->|Async Log| Queue[Local Queue (Redis)]
    end

    subgraph "Background Infrastructure"
        Queue --> Worker[Worker Service]
        Worker --> DB[(Postgres)]
        Worker --> Metrics[Prometheus]
    end
    
    SDK -.->|LLM Call| OpenAI[LLM Provider]
```

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 20+**
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for Redis/Postgres)

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo (Monorepo setup)
git clone https://github.com/your-org/llm-governance.git
cd llm-governance
npm install
```

### 2. Start Infrastructure
Start Redis (for the queue) and Postgres (for logs).

```bash
docker-compose up -d
npx prisma db push --schema=libs/common/prisma/schema.prisma
```

### 3. Start the Worker Service
The worker consumes logs from the queue and persists them to the database.

```bash
npm start -w apps/worker
```

### 4. Use the SDK in Your App

Initialize the SDK and wrap your LLM calls.

```javascript
import llm from '@llm-governance/sdk';

// 1. Initialize with your policy
llm.init({
    policyPath: './path/to/guardrails.yml'
});

// 2. Wrap your LLM calls
const response = await llm.observe({
    input: "User prompt",
    model: "gpt-4",
    provider: "openai",
    metadata: { user_id: "123" }
}, async () => {
    // Your existing code (e.g., OpenAI SDK)
    return await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: "gpt-4",
        messages: [{ role: "user", content: "User prompt" }]
    });
});
```

### 5. Run the Demo

See the SDK in action with a simulated LLM provider:

```bash
node examples/sdk-demo.js
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Guardrails Policy
Define your security rules in a YAML file (e.g., `policies/default.yml`):

```yaml
input:
  secrets_detection:
    enabled: true
    action: reject

output:
  pii_detection:
    enabled: true
    categories: [email, phone]
    action: mask
    mask_token: "[REDACTED]"
```

## 📊 Comparison

| Feature | Gateway Approach (Old) | SDK Approach (New) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integration** | Requires changing API endpoints | Import library, wrap code |
| **Latency** | Network hop added | Microseconds (In-process) |
| **Failure Mode** | Gateway down = App down | DB down = App keeps working (Async queue) |
| **Complexity** | High (Separate service to manage) | Low (Part of your app) |
